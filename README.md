# SPEKTR

A computational tool for x‚Äêray spectrum modeling and analysis.

Spektr is a MATLAB toolkit for calculation of x-ray spectra, selection of elemental and compound filters, and calculation of beam quality characteristics, such as half-value layer, mR/mAs, and fluence per unit exposure. The toolset provides x-ray spectrum calculation from 1 to 150 keV in 1 keV energy bins using the TASMIP model of Boone and Seibert, with polynomial coefficients contained in the data file TASMIP.xls. Modeling of beam filtration is facilitated by an extensible database of mass and mass-energy attenuation coefficients compiled from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
